  \section add_game How to add a game
  This page will explain how to add a game library in our Arcade program.\n

  \subsection step1 Location
  First, you must put your game lib at the root of the games folder and its name
   must follow this convention : lib_arcade_GAMENAME.so\n

  \subsection step2 Entry Point Creation
  Each game must have an entry point. This entry point is used by the core to
  load the game in the program.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
  # GAME_CLASS_NAME class

  extern "C" IGame *instance_ctor() {
      return (new GAME_CLASS_NAME);
  };
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  \subsection step3 Class implementation
